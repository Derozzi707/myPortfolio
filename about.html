          <p>
            Founded in 2024 by Derek Iozzio of Phoenix, AZ. Derek got his start
            in programming through California Institute of Arts and Technology,
            learning the skills necessary to develop software and technologies
            in our digital age. He began to work as a freelance web designer,
            doing front-end work using HTML and CSS, before expanding to
            full-stack web development, utilizing additional programming
            languages to begin developing full websites. In the future, he plans
            to hire on full-time staff for Graphic Design, Photography, and
            additional team members for web development, to allow for expansion
            into full-scale software development of web-apps, mobile
            applications, and beyond. In his free time, he enjoys PC gaming for
            Rocket League and Hell Let Loose and exploring all genres of music
            through playing guitar and piano.
